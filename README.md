# Aim: To Study & Implement Linked List.

# Tool: VS CODE.

# Theory:

•	Linked List is a linear data structure, in which elements are not stored at a contiguous location, rather they are linked using pointers. 

•	Linked List forms a series of connected nodes, where each node stores the data and the address of the next node.

Why linked list data structure needed?

•	Dynamic Data structure: The size of memory can be allocated or de-allocated at run time based on the operation insertion or deletion.

•	Ease of Insertion/Deletion: The insertion and deletion of elements are simpler than arrays since no elements need to be shifted after insertion and deletion, Just the address needed to be updated.

•	Efficient Memory Utilization: As we know Linked List is a dynamic data structure the size increases or decreases as per the requirement so this avoids the wastage of memory. 

•	Implementation: Various advanced data structures can be implemented using a linked list like a stack, queue, graph, hash maps, etc.
