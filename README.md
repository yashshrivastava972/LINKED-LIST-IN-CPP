# Aim: To Study & Implement Linked List.

# Tool: VS CODE.

# Theory:

•	Linked List is a linear data structure, in which elements are not stored at a contiguous location, rather they are linked using pointers. 

•	Linked List forms a series of connected nodes, where each node stores the data and the address of the next node.

Why linked list data structure needed?

•	Dynamic Data structure: The size of memory can be allocated or de-allocated at run time based on the operation insertion or deletion.

•	Ease of Insertion/Deletion: The insertion and deletion of elements are simpler than arrays since no elements need to be shifted after insertion and deletion, Just the address needed to be updated.

•	Efficient Memory Utilization: As we know Linked List is a dynamic data structure the size increases or decreases as per the requirement so this avoids the wastage of memory. 

•	Implementation: Various advanced data structures can be implemented using a linked list like a stack, queue, graph, hash maps, etc.

## BRIEF INTRODUCTION

A linked list is a linear data structure where elements (called nodes) are stored at non-contiguous memory locations.

Each node contains data and a pointer (link) to the next node.

Unlike arrays, linked lists can dynamically grow or shrink in size.

## TYPES OF LINKED LIST

SINGLY LINKED LIST

Each node points to the next node.

Traversal is possible only in one direction.

DOUBLY LINKED LIST

Each node has two pointers: one to the next node and one to the previous node.

Traversal is possible in both directions.

CIRCULAR LINKED LIST

The last node points back to the first node.

Can be singly or doubly circular.

## BASIC OPERATIONS

CREATION OF NODE – Define structure/class with data and next pointer.

INSERTION – Add a node at the start, end, or any given position.

DELETION – Remove a node from the start, end, or a specific position.

TRAVERSAL / DISPLAY – Visit and print all nodes.

SEARCHING – Locate a node with a specific value.

## ADVANTAGES

Dynamic memory allocation (no need to know size in advance).

Efficient insertion and deletion (no shifting like arrays).

Can implement stacks, queues, and other advanced data structures.

## DISADVANTAGES

Extra memory required for storing pointers.

Sequential access (cannot access elements directly like arrays).

Traversing can be slower compared to arrays.

## APPLICATIONS

Used in implementing stacks, queues, and graphs.

Dynamic memory management.

Useful in polynomial manipulation, memory allocation tables, and file systems.
